# DataSample-and-Test-Suite
This project is for generating a sequence that passs all the NIST test suite,  TestU01 batteries and Hamano et al.'s new test,
but will be rejected by our proposed DM-1 and DM-2 test.

##1. Generate the Sample Sequence 

   The code for generating the sample data is in the file "GenerateSample.c", in which the data file "rdseed.data" is used as input.  Compile this single c source file and run it, then you will get the output file "biggap10_4_1", which is the same as "sample.data".

##2. Test the Sample Data by NIST and TestU01 Test Suite

   Unzip these two compression packsï¼Œthere are README or INSTALL files in both of them. Follow the README or INSTALL files and you will get the corresponding executable files after compiling. Then  you may test the generated file "biggap10_4_1". Notice that the size of this data file is 10^9 bits. For the NIST test suite, the input sequence size should be 10^6, and the number of sequences should be 1000.  While for TestU01 batteries, the input size is 10^9.

##3. Test the Generated Sample Data by NIST Linear Complexity Test, HSY Test and our proposed Deviation Measure Tests

   These source files are in the directory ./LinearComplexityRandomTest. Enter this directory and compile these c source files with a command like:

            gcc -o FileTest *.c -lm -fopenmp 
   
   Notice that the input parameter "-fopenmp" in this command is for parallelization,  since there are some codes for parallelization in  "LC_Random_Test.c" by the instruction of omp. Then, there will be an executable file named "FileTest", and you can test the sample data by
           
           ./FileTest ../biggap10_4_1 TestResult.txt
   
   Experimental results of these 4 test methods for "biggap_10_4_1"  are in the file "TestResult.txt", including both P and U results, and the number of rejected sequences according to the criteria of U.
